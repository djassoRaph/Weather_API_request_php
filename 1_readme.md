# Hi there.

So to get things up and running, get a linux terminal and a docker running.

browse with terminal unto this folder, run the following command :

```
$ docker build -t weather_app .
```

You will have my little api weather app on your docker available in your images list.
From there you can run it, and then launch an console from there. 
You can directly input a city name and you'll get your api request.

If you enter the cli of docker, 
You'll have to manually run the weather.php file by typing :
```
php weather.php
```
Then just type a city name and press enter.

I am new to docker. 
I haven't done tests in 2 years.

Kind regards,

Raphael RECK.
