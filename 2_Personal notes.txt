>"Docker BuildKit: faster builds, new features, and now itâ€™s stable (7 minute read)
Docker BuildKit is a new backend for building images. It features faster builds using parallelism, 
support for securely passing build secrets, upgradeability, and more. There are still some issues with it,
but workarounds are available. BuildKit is enabled by default on new macOS and Windows installs, 
so developers should make sure their builds work correctly on it."

#Following tutorial
Installed linux ubuntu onto my computer/windows build and trying to use a buildkit on docker
followed a bunch of things to do on websites such as the link above and the suggested URLS of the initial install of docker.

#Started a php file, then it's late and now I need sleep.

went to bed, woke up.
13/01/21
Reading about the  https://openweathermap.org/api. documentation
I might need a list of cities.
https://datahub.io/core/world-cities#resource-world-cities_zip
Use a json file probably

Did some coding

Re read the Task file.md
Understood stuff
I thought I was also going to have a test about a curl POST. 
But I don't see it anywhere.
Went to work

14/01/21
18h00 Working on weaher.php
Downloaded a json file with all the cities of the world, and did some json manipulation to just get a list of cities. See discarded_code.php.
Finished the whole curl request for city and temprature results, doing some esthetic :
Tests to make sure the user doesn't request for a <i>beer</i> instead of the weather of a city.
Did some json file manipulation to have a list of cities

18h30

Going to use it to see if the user input is a real city name.
I noticed that if I type Lubiana, I get a return name as Ljubljana,
On their side there must be some kind of process of the inputs;
The API has more cities than my curreny world_cities.json 
Name is a city in China... Lon 109 & Lat 23 Aprox 

19h07
Figure out regex input.
What do I do with LONDON USA or LONDON UK!? OMG OR LONDON CANADA? // Nothing, I'll sleep on it

I'm getting unexpected errors about php/<i class="fas fa-caret-square-left    "></i>. I need to reboot the computer or something. 
Something to do with the error return on the curl...?


Conclusion, get a working docker...
note to self
sudo apt-get install php-curl fixed it, on both sides in wsl and in powershell... ah the mysteries of computers.
Linx command line returns more information than windows cmd.
fixed a bits and bobs it's now 20:45 going to sleep 

15/01/21
woke up and got a docker version running.
Adding comments here and there.

Went to Work

Trying to understand where I can integrate tests on this...phpUnit? 
tests are done on user input.. I haven't done tests in over two years.

Re read the task file.md 
PSR-2 coding type adjusted. Going to run PHP_CodeSniffer.


16/01/21
In order to use php unit. I need to have classes and name space. Which I did not do. Sad face.
Now to make things perfect I need two tests... Hrmm. I have not done tests in over two years... 
Found something.
I don't have the time to integrate phpUnit into this project.
Did some tweaking now I have somewhat something that looks like a class with a namespace...
Added tests and and more "if user inputs error"


// 19h00 Prepping to send file.

Just went I was doing some final testing. I got an error... 

Took me about and hour and 20 minutes to find what I was looking for. 
I was trying with preg_match() and preg_replace() but it was going no where.
I tried filter_var() but in the end the solution was to use : escapeshellcmd()
I didn't want people sending funny requests through to the API! 




20:20 Final tests, exporting to docker image.

zipping folder and so and so,

thank you for your time. 

Kind regards
